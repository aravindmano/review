                <h3><b>Top Three Tamil Actors With the Largest fanbase- a statistical list</b></h3>
                  <h2>by tamilmovietrends created 30 Nov 2015 | last updated - 05 June 2016</h2>
                  <br/>
                    Tamil Actors have a lot of passionate fans, who are crazy for their stars...
                    Even during the time of M.G.R and Sivaji Ganeshan there were a lot of movie fanatics who'd only watch
                    their respective stars' movies. In a way this trend is degrading tamil movie..But looking at it
                    positively a lot of tamil actors are getting high initial collection for their movies.. This is a global list...
                    stars who have a tamil fan base may not have a global fan base... So i dont encourage anyone to
                    start any arguments here..

                      Shivaji Rao Gaekwad (Rajnikanth) was born on December 12, 1949 in
                    Karnataka. He was a bus conductor during which time he reportedly
                    caught the fancy of the bus travelers with his mannerisms and style of
                     issuing tickets and blowing the whistle and so on. Looking to become an actor,
                     he moved to Chennai and joined the film institute...</p><hr>
                    Lovingly called as 'Thalaivar' and 'Superstar' this man has come a
                    long way from being an ordinary bus conductor..
                    he attractd tamil audiences through his style and charisma..
                    Even though he staryed off as a villain, he became hero later...
                    He is now the most paid actor in Asia, slightly behind the legendary
                    Jackie Chan..His fan base is spread over all the continents, and especially in
                    countries where there is a predominant tamil population such as UK, Japan, Australia etc..

                  <h2>Actor,<a href="#">Thupaaki</a></h2>
                    <article1 align="justify"><p>Vijay was born to a famous Tamil film producer and director S. A. Chandrasekhar.
                      His career geared up when he acted in Ghilli, one of the biggest blockbuster in Tamilnadu. He has won awards
                       such as the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actor and Dinakaran Best Actor Award.
                       Vijay was given an Honorary doctorate title in 2007 for his social services.</p><hr>
                       Darlingly called "Ilayathalapathy" or young commander, this man has the second
                       largest fan base for a tamil actor..
                       Vijay started off with a few films that didnt do well.. but from 1994 to 2005 none of his
                        films failed to collect
                       more than it budget which gave him the name "vasool chakravarty"..
                       Vijay's fan base resulted from the fact that his movies coincided with India's so called "Love revolution",
                       whereby relationships among boys and girls were frowned upon less..vijay's movies gave interesting concepts in
                       love earlier..but nowadays its mostly action dramas... Vijay enjoys a hige fan following in South India.
                       In kerala his fanbase extends more than even local stars Mohanal and Mammooty
                       the same situation extends to karnataka too..Globally Vijay has fans in Sri Lanka,
                       Thailand, Malaysia, UK, USA and Australia
                       Even though some of his movies did not fare well after 2005 he came back strongly with
                       Kaavalan and Velayudham..The interesting fact here is that even though Vijay lost many fans
                       after 2005 his fanbase is still growing... No one can explain this..people connect with Vijay..this is
                       one person to look out for claiming rajinikanth's throne.. <article1>

                    film "Kalathoor Kannamma" (1960), which was released in the year 1960. Since then, he has starred
                     in nearly 200 films in the major Indian languages - Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi.
                      He has been a part of the film industry for 52 years...</p><hr>
                   Although he is in the lead of Rajinikath, he has less number of fans than Vijay and Ajithkumar
                   because of his aversion to commercial cinema..he is considered as the best actor in tamil cinema,
                   but his movies often do not have anything to cater to the taste of fans...and so his fans decreased..
                   But a lot of people who likes serious movies are his fans..
                   his comic timing is superb...and no one can match his emotions..</article1>
